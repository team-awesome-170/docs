#1. Business Requirements

##1.1 Background
The CS department must post Faculty Information Cards each semester outside the office where they sit.  The information cards are printed for each semester to include information for the faculty member, the courses he/she teaches, and office infomration including location, phone number and times that the faculty member can be found there.

__Questions__

* How is the information to complete the cards currently stored (database, spreadsheet, etc..)  
* How are the cards completed and printed (word template?)

##1.2 Business Opportunity
A new software system should be designed and implemented that will ease the administrative burden required to produce the printed Faculty Information Cards.  The system needs to be usable by staff without requiring a high degree of technical skills.  The software should be generalized so that it may be easily migrated or scaled to other departments, campuses or schools.

The software is intended for internal department.  Optionally, other departments may utilize the system but will be required to have their own administrator and clerk.  Any administrator would be able to set up their own clerk, create another department and grant authority to the admin or reset another admin's password.
